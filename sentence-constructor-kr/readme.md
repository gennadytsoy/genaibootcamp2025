# General Information
This is a Korean Language Sentence Constructor (KLSC). 

The optimal person for the KLSC would be a beginner level individual (student) who is can read Korean, but still doesn't have enough vocabulary or understanding of tenses and particles to form a complete sentence.

The expected utilization would be for KLSC to assist a student to learn Korean day to day situational scenarios.
